# What is this website?

Detailed notes of a basement build from start to finish. It'll document a full DIY basement build from start to finish. We'll be breaking the build into discrete steps and address questions like
- What steps? In what order?
- Costs?
- How much time to allocate?

# How to read?

- Use the left-hand navigation to see the steps (they are in order from start to finish)
- Each step will detail the costs and rough time needed (along with the actual work invovled)
- I'll include sketches, links to videos, links to products along the way
